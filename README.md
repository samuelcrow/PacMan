Exercise on a pacman animation that moves back and forth.  
## PacMan Animation  
This is my **first** project with code that I'm submitting with GitHub. It's quite exciting to think about all the project that are soon to come thanks to the **amazing** people at MIT | Xpro online bootcamp.

### Roadmap  
It would be a lot of fun to make pacman do the following:

- Make him into the full game
