# PacMan
A PacMan game where you can spawn in PacMen, they have a random velocity, and they bounce around when you press start.  
## PacMan Game  
This is a PacMan game that I created with the help of MIT | xPro program.  In the game, there are two buttons, a start button and an add button.  The add button will add a PacMan to the screen.  The start button will basically start the game and add a random velocity and speed to each of the PacMen.
